Greetings and welcome to the **Spawner Swarm**! Thank you for joining our quaint community. Please spend a few minutes combing this document so that you can be informed on how we manage the clan.

Currently, some of our members are probably enjoying themselves massacring hordes of Infested, dying to Torbjörn’s turret, or chatting with each other on Discord. If you have any questions or need help, please feel free to ask any of your new fellows! We will see you on the other side.

\t- Guild Master <@139109512744402944>

Like any good clan, there are structures and rules in place to ward against chaos. Please take some time to familiarize yourself with them:

**1)**  Always respect your clanmates.
**2)**  Your leaders have the final say, but please make your opinions known so we can act according to the will of the guild.
**3)**  If you have a problem with anyone in the clan that cannot be resolved interpersonally, please contact an Officer. We will not divulge your complaints or your identity without your direct consent. (Screenshots will be very helpful if you are able to provide them)
**4)**  You are responsible for your account’s security. You are responsible for any actions taken under its guise.
**5)**  If you need help, feel free to ask your fellow guildmates, but don’t get mad at them if they are unable or unwilling to; they have issues of their own as well.
**6)**  You must remain an active member of our community to remain in the guild. If you’re gone for more than 30 days, you will be kicked. being active on Discord counts as activity. If you need to take a leave of absence, please let us know first so we can extend this time.
\split
**7)**  During our clan cleaning (of inactive members not on leave), we will give everyone a 1-week notice to come back to Discord or log in to the game and mention they are still active. We will determine inactivity based on your last messages in Discord or presence in-game.
**8)**  Please respect our organization on Discord, we have specific channels for a reason. *(Don’t post meme dumps on #general, and don’t have discussions in #swarmbotpatchnotes)*
**9)**  **Do not under any circumstances post illegal or malicious content on any platform or distribute it unsolicited to our members. This will result in an immediate ban and adequate legal measures will be taken.**
**10)** Do not under any circumstances post illegal or malicious content on any platform or distribute it unsolicited to our members. This will result in an immediate ban and adequate legal measures will be taken.
**11)** Please donate resources within your means to guild projects. We work together, and that includes donating to projects.
**12)** Don’t post affiliate links, referral links/codes, or advertisements for other communities without the GMs’ permission!
