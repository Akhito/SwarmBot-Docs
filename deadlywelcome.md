Welcome to the Deadly Runners Division!

This is a display of this clan's best builds, submitted by a wide array of clan members.  Each build provides a title to each individual.  Rivens are kept seperate from the builds, and  screenshots of each build are provided where :riven: is available.  Click :id: to recieve the identification of the build via pm.  The order of information on the top of the build goes as follows; build name, weapon/warframe name, master holder.

*Submission Proccess*
The specifics on what is allowed for builds is detailed in the deadly runners information, please do `!help deadlyrunners` to recieve a pm detailing the information.  Submissions are to be private messaged to @Zealous Vindictor#3277 , who will determine if the submitted build is objectively better than the previous build.  If so, your build will be posted, and  you will be awarded the mastery title for the build, and the previous build will be archived.
