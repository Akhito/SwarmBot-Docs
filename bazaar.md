Welcome to the Bazaar!

Here you can place buy and sell orders for any item. You will be automatically notified when an offer is placed on one of your listings.

To create a listing, please follow this format:

`[WTB|WTS] [NN] (30k CR) Item Name Here`

* [WTB|WTS]: Indicates the type of listing you are creating. WTB stands for "Want to Buy", while WTS stands for "Want to Sell"

* [NN] (optional): Indicates that the offer is non-negotiable. **Please do not solicit non-negotiable offers if you are not comfortable with the listed price.**

* (30k CR): The price of the item followed by a currency listing. Valid currency values are CR, CE, Plat(inum), <:Crown:318234064941350912>, <:CrownFlat:318536338934857728>, <:Energy:318527974557089792>, and <:Platinum:230528518147145731>

The Bazaar functions are available in the reactions to a listing message. Do not remove a reaction that is not your own.

* <:Shop:318235877002444810>: Usable by any user to place an offer on a listing. Once clicked, the user who placed the listing will be notified via Direct Message.

* <:Disconnect:318532170018979843>: Usable by the user who placed a listing to close that listing. Once clicked, the listing message will be deleted and all offers removed. **This cannot be reversed**
